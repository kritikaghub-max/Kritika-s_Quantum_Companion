# Kritika’s Quantum Companion
**Visualizing Quantum Memory:** Turn research insights into an interactive, layman-friendly dashboard  

---

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+  
- Qiskit  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Pandas  
- Requests  
- Jupyter (optional for notebooks)  

---

## Project Overview
Kritika simulates a **quantum memory system** that:  
- Converts topic relevance scores from multiple research problems into **quantum states**.  
- Performs **multi-cycle updates** to combine knowledge across problems.  
- Samples the **top quantum memory states** to generate insights.  
- Visualizes results in a **layman-friendly dashboard** for easy interpretation.  

This allows both **technical and non-technical viewers** to understand which topics are strongly represented and where uncertainty remains.  

---

## Key Features
- **Live Data Integration:** Fetches research papers from arXiv to compute topic scores.  
- **Quantum Memory Encoding:** Uses Qiskit to encode topic relevance into 3 qubits.  
- **Multi-Cycle Updates:** Combines insights from multiple problems.  
- **Insight Sampling:** Produces top memory states for analysis.  
- **Dashboard Visualization:**
  - **Heatmap:** Topic Strength (0–1)  
  - **Bar Chart:** Topic Uncertainty (0–1)  
  - **Table:** Sampled memory states and metrics  

---

## Interpreting the Dashboard

### Heatmap – Topic Strength (0–1)
- Darker blue → stronger representation of the topic in memory.  
- Example: A value of `0.8` means the topic is strongly encoded.  

### Bar Chart – Topic Uncertainty (0–1)
- Higher bars → more uncertainty in the memory about that topic.  
- Helps identify which topics are **well-established** vs **ambiguous**.  

### Table – Sampled Memory States
- Shows **top 3-qubit states** sampled from quantum memory.  
- Includes **topic strength** and **uncertainty** for each problem.  

### Visualizations
- Saved example plots can be found in the `images/` folder.  
- Recommended to view **heatmap + bar chart together** for a full picture of memory dynamics.
